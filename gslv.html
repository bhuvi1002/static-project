 	 The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) project was initiated in 1990,
	 with the objective of acquiring an Indian launch capability for geosynchronous satellites.
	The first development flight of the GSLV (Mk.I configuration) was launched on 18 April 2001
 	was a failure as the payload failed to reach the intended orbit parameters
	GSLV-F01 launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota,
	 to place EDUSAT -India's first communication satellite dedicated to educational purposes- 
	in orbit on September 20, 2004  (GSLV), 
	is an expendable launch system operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
	The GSLV can place approximately 5,000 kg into an easterly Low Earth orbit or 2,500 kg	
	into an 18° geostationary transfer orbit.GSLV uses major components that are already proven in the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)
	 launchers in the form of the S125/S139 solid rocket booster and the liquid-fueled Vikas engine.
