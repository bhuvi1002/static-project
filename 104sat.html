	 The Indian space research organization (ISRO) launched 104 satellites into orbit aboved the polar satellite launch
 	vehicle on feb 15 2017 in its 39th flight.PSLV-C37 was used for this mission that delivered a payload of 1,378 kg into space in its
 	38th consecutive successful flight. The greatest degree of difficulty in the mission has been attributed to the synchronous release of the satellite payload 
	from the final stage of the PSLV rocket.ISRO successfully launched 104 satellites by a single rocket on 15 February 2017,
	 of which 3 satellites are Indian satellites while the remaining are foreign commercial satellites. 
	Finally, the last 20 nanosats successfully separated in a different sequence, ISRO officials said.
	All "104 satellites have been very precisely injected into orbit.. " ISRO officials said during the live broadcast following the launch. 
	India's prime minister, Narendra Modi,also congratulated the ISRO for a successful launch.
