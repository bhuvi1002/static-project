	Bradford Parkinson, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University, 
	conceived the present satellite-based system in the early 1960s
	 and developed it in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force.

	A satellite navigation system is a system that uses satellites to provide
 	autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic 
	receivers to determine their location to high precision using time signals
 	transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can
 	be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of 
	something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow
 	the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision,
 	which allows time synchronisation.
