		The Satellite Launch Vehicle or SLV is a Small-lift launch vehicle, 
		was a project started in the early 1970s by the Indian Space Research Organisation to develop the technology needed to launch satellites.
		 SLV was intended to reach a height of 400 kilometres  and carry a payload of 40 kg .
		The first experimental flight of SLV-3, in August 1979, was a failure. 
		It was a four-stage rocket with all solid-propellant motors.
		<b>The first successful launch took place on 18 July, 1980.

		The first launch of the SLV took place in Sriharikota on 10 August 1979.</b> 
		The fourth and final launch of the SLV took place on 17 April 1983.
		It has taken approximately seven years to realise the vehicle from start.
		The successful culmination of the SLV-3 project showed the way to advanced launch vehicle projects 
		such as the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and 
		the Geosynchronous satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).
